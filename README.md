This iOS app allows users to monitor and record their mood. They can either rate their mood from 1 to 5 in the Mood tab or chat to our MooMoobot to describe how they are feeling and why. MooMoobot will provide appropriate responses and advice - it will even send you a funny meme if you feel like it! The user can track their moods over time and see graphical depictions of their data on our Charts tab. They can also view a diary of their moods and see an average on our Journal tab.
